# physics-based-DL

This repository contains my personal notes and summaries as I learn from the [Physics-Based Deep Learning](https://physicsbaseddeeplearning.org/intro.html) online book. The goal is to document key concepts, insights, and code examples encountered throughout the learning process. This repo serves as a reference for myself and anyone interested in the intersection of physics and deep learning.
